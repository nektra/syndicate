# Syndicate Smart Contract

## Overview
The Syndicate Smart Contract was developed to receive investments to buy ICO tokens, buy the tokens negotiating a bonus price for the whole amount of Ethers, and finally, investors receive the ICO tokens after the lock period while administrators get a bonus if the tokens increase their original value more than 2X.

## Parties
**Administrators:** a list of addresses with a related % for each one. E.g.: [0x1111, 30%, 0x2222, 70%]. The total % must SUM exactly 100%. These addresses receive the administration fee and the bonus if it applies.

**Contract developer (CoinFabrik):** the address which will be able to make configuration changes.

**Investors:** the addresses which send ether to the smart contract and will receive tokens in exchange.

## Details

**Steps:**
1) Investors send their Ethers to the Syndicate Smart Contract.
2)Contract Developer calls a function of the Syndicate Smart Contract to buy the tokens from the ICO Smart Contract specifying the starting token price which will be the base to calculate the bonus fee. 1% of the Ethers are sent to the administrators. 
NOTE: If this function is not called after the buy period (30 days), investors can withdraw the ethers including the administration fee.
3)After the lock period (1 year), Contract Developer will call the end of locking function specifying the token price at the end of the period (CoinMarketCap price at the 0:00 EST after 1 year exactly after the token purchase). After this call, investors can withdraw their tokens subtracting the bonus fee. The bonus fee (20% over 2X of the original price) is paid if the token value increases above 2 times the original value (e.g.: if the token price was original $10 and after one year is $25, bonus fee will be ($25-2*$10)*0.2 = $1 per token). This bonus is paid in tokens. 
NOTE: If this function is not called after 10 days from the end of the locking period, investors can withdraw tokens without paying the bonus fee. 

##(*) Functions:
- tokenBalance: it returns the token balance equivalent to the share of the tokens according to the investment. This balance can change if the bonus fee trigger is reached. 
- withdrawEther: in case the buy period is due, investors can claim their Ether using this function.
- withdrawTokens: after the lock period ends and the administrators call the end function (or after 10 days of the lock period), investors can call this function to get their tokens.

(*) Some implementation changes are expected but they will not change the general functionality of the Smart Contract
